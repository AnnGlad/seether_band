      <img src="img/SEETHER-2019.jpg" alt="SEETHER-2019">
      <p>Hailing from South Africa and comprising members Shaun Morgan (vocals, guitar), Dale Stewart (bass), and John
        Humphrey (drums), Seether embrace a brand of heavy metal mostly associated with the post-grunge era of
        alternative music, complete with crunchy distortion and brooding textures. The band emerged in 1999 as Saron
        Gas
        (a name taken from the back of a sound effects CD) and released its debut album, Fragile, the following year
        on
        Musketeer Records. In a country whose musical tastes center around pop and indigenous music, Fragile found
        impressive chart success. Across the Atlantic, the U.S.-based Wind Up Records caught wind of the band's
        growing
        popularity and signed the South African bandmates, who changed their name to Seether in light of Saron Gas'
        similarity to the lethal nerve agent sarin gas.</p>
      <p>An EP release and a spot on the Ozzfest tour preceded the unveiling of Seether's full-length debut in the
        summer of 2002. Issued that August, Disclaimer featured the modern rock single "Fine Again" and led to a
        year-long tour, during which singer Morgan's relationship with Evanescence siren Amy Lee blossomed. But while
        the tour ensured increasing commercial status for Seether, it also delayed the band's return to the studio. In
        March 2004, a few tracks appeared on the Punisher soundtrack, including a duet version of Disclaimer's
        "Broken"
        featuring vocal contributions from Lee. Disclaimer II appeared that June, pairing a handful of new tracks with
        remixed or re-recorded versions of the previous album's tracks. Seether viewed the album as an opportunity to
        re-evaluate their debut's release (whose mix was, according to the band, subpar) and give listeners new
        content
        as a holdover until the band's proper follow-up.</p>
      <p>The promised sophomore effort, Karma and Effect, was released in May 2005 and entered the Top Ten, while the
        acoustic CD/DVD package One Cold Night appeared in 2006. Following Morgan's breakup with Amy Lee and a
        successful stint in rehab, Seether returned in 2007 with Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces, introducing the
        album with the snide and catchy single "Fake It." In 2009 the bandmembers took a break from touring to head
        into
        the studio with producer Brendan O'Brien to work on their fifth album. They went back out on the road for
        another year before eventually releasing Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray in 2011. Isolate and
        Medicate,
        the band's sixth studio long-player, dropped in 2014, and shot to the top of Billboard's Top Rock,
        Alternative,
        and Hard Rock charts. In February 2017 the band dropped "Let You Down," the first single from their much
        anticipated seventh studio long-player, Poison the Parish, which arrived later that May. ~ Bradley Torreano &

      <div class="column-text">
        <p>In the late 90’s Saron Gas started blowing up the music scene with their first album,<em> Fragile</em>. </p>
        <p>Twenty years later, Saron Gas is still performing, but who is Saron Gas and why have we not heard the name
          until
          now? In 1999, Wind Up Records signed Saron Gas, who exploded the music scene for Grunge Metal and Alternative
          Rock.
          They were a small band from South Africa consisting of three guys: Shaun Morgan (vocals, guitar), Dale Stewart
          (bass), and John Humphrey (drums). </p>
        <p>In 2002 Wind Up Records asked them to change their name to who we all know and love today, Seether. </p>
        <p>Seether made their debut in 2002 during their first ever Ozzfest tour where they were able to expose their
          entire
          album, <em>Disclaimer</em>. Seether continued touring after Ozzfest, which caused a halt in studio time. </p>
        <p>Two years later, in 2004, <em>Disclaimer Two</em> came out. While fans were excited to see a fresh album,
          Seether
          was getting ready to hit the road with Evanescence on their North American tour with openers Three Days Grace
          and
          Breaking Benjamin. </p>
        <p>It's no secret that Seether is not the largest rock band in the world, but they've done pretty good for
          themselves
          within these twenty years of being a band. They're one of the few rock bands that have had numerous hit songs
          on
          the
          charts like "Fake It", "Broken", "Nobody Praying For Me", "Country Song", "Words As Weapons", "Breakdown", and
          numerous others.</p>
        <p> As they continued their music journey in the industry we've had the pleasure of hearing eight spectacular
          albums
          like <em>Fragile</em> (2002), <em>Disclaimer </em>(2002), <em>Disclaimer II </em>(2004), <em>Karma and Effect
          </em>(2005), <em>Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces </em>(2007), <em>Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray
          </em>(2011), <em>Isolate and Medicate </em>(2014), and <em>Poison the Parish </em>(2017)</p>
        <p>Seether has had the pleasure of hitting the stage with Three Days Grace, Finger Eleven, Breaking Benjamin, 3
          Doors
          Down, Skillet, Red, Papa Roach, Flyleaf, Staind, and many other bands within their twenty years of touring.
        </p>
        <p>As they approach their current 20th Anniversary Tour, they approach it alone with no opening acts and an
          extra
          member. It's unheard of today when a band goes on tour with no supporting artist and brings on new members to
          the
          band. </p>
        <p>In 2018 Seether, brought Corey Lowery on board to join backup vocals and the guitar. They opened their 20th
          Anniversary Tour at Harrah's Resort Southern California Casino on April 20th, 2019. It was an interesting
          choice
          for
          a venue location. Regardless, free parking, reasonably priced food and drinks, and then having the casino as
          your
          entertainment before and after the show. Who could complain about that? Not us, that's for sure. </p>
        <p>Seether's lead singer Shaun Morgan recently spoke about making tickets affordable and reasonable for fans to
          purchase. A pit ticket was around the 30 dollar mark and then a seat was anywhere from 30 to 60 dollars. If a
          fan
          wanted to be towards the front and have the best eye view as possible they had to pay for a VIP Pit ticket
          which
          was
          around 70 dollars. Overall, the entire show was reasonably priced and we were impressed to see how well they
          took
          care of their fans to ensure a good time for them.</p>
        <p>As the show got closer to show time, the crowds were nowhere to be seen except for die hard fans. We decided
          to
          use
          this time to talk to fans and approached Jesse L. (43) who said, “I've been listening to Seether for nearly
          half
          my
          life. They mean the world to me and every time they are in town I've dropped everything to see them. I drove 7
          hours
          to get to this show today. I was hoping they would have a VIP meet and greet for this show so I could give
          them
          the
          flowers I brought them, (the flowers were on stage as we spoke) but sadly they didn't. I can't wait to see
          what
          they
          have in store for on stage.” </p>
        <p>A little after 8 pm and Seether came out ready to go. They held a strong four man front on stage. Lead singer
          Shaun
          Morgan to the left of the stage, Bass Guitar Dale Stewart center stage, Drummer John Humphrey back center, and
          new
          Guitarist Corey Lowery right stage. The layout of member positions was a bit off at first but it grew on the
          fans
          quickly. </p>
        <p>As soon as Shaun Morgan said, “Hello we're Seether.” the fans roared out of control and the venue was full.
          Not
          a
          single empty spot was left on the floor. Fans of all ages were standing in front of the band chanting
          "Seether".
          As
          the energy grew from the crowd, so did the band. They started out slow and quiet and then busted out the hair
          flips
          and guitar kicks on stage. Fans were screaming at the top of their lungs to be noticed by the band and were
          soon
          rewarded by Shaun and Corey throwing guitar picks to the crowd. </p>
        <p>They played a two hour, emotional set for fans to hear with new and old songs like "Fake It", "Country Song",
          "Remedy", "Fine Again", "Rise Above This", "Nobody Praying for Me", "Let You Down", "Words as Weapons", "Stoke
          the
          Fire", and more. </p>
